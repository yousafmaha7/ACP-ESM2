# ACP-ESM2: Anticancer Peptide Prediction Tool

This Streamlit web application uses a pretrained ESM-2 model and AdaBoost classifier to predict whether a given peptide sequence is an anticancer peptide (ACP).

## ðŸš€ Features

- Accepts peptide sequences in FASTA format
- Extracts ESM-2 embeddings
- Applies a trained AdaBoost model to classify sequences
- Interactive Streamlit-based UI
